IMAGE SEGMENTATION BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION
â€¢The project is image segmentation and object detection of human brain tumor with the help of MRI
scans. Using deep learning like the state of the art YOLOV7 algorithm, roboflow, numpy and pandas
we are able to segment pretty accurately with the f1-confidence curve of 0.84 at 0.130 and precisionrecall curve at 0.878.
